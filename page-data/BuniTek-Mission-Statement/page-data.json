This experience is a commonplace to the majority of young Africans. Their education entails learning trivial concepts and spend the entire time memorising the names of the computer components and never learn the big picture and hands-on skills of what the computer technology can help them to achieve. Consequently, they wind up dropping the subject and concentrating on fields that they feel directly relate to their life reality. This is unacceptable as it leads to under utilisation of talented minds at this era where the surge of artificial intelligence and use of computer technology in other fields is at its peak; inspite of that, there also is,  relatively, a huge technical and technology skill gap in Africa while it is imperative that the continent compete in a digital global economy. The kids are denied a fair chance to explore their abilities just because of where they were born and the financial circumstances of their families.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, our mission is to inspire, encourage, and give every kid a fair shot at discovering the technology potential and provide a ground for them to explore and employ their skills to solve problems and invent the future. We facilitate and create an environment for young people to learn how technology could be used to build powerful tools and change status quo. In addition to arousing interest and disseminating knowledge, we want to inspire creativity, innovation and ethics in using technology. Moreover, we want to promote transferable skills such as collaboration, communication, critical and design thinking in solving problems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, we envisage to build the next generation of Africa's problem solvers because we believe that if one is digitally literate and employs the technology capability, there is no problem that is too big solve. Having these thinkers spread out in all regions of Africa that we plan to cover means, unequivocally, that they will be able to come up with solutions specific to their particular areas and this will not only inspire the development we year, but also will curb the culture of plagiarising foreign solutions which rarely works in the context of Africa. This will heighten the living standards of people in their communities and foster Africa's economic growth in the long run.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Our Tutors</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Besides helping the young people, it is also our mission to help our student tutors grow their skills. In preparation for their lessons, we will provide them with trainings and support they need need to provide first-rate quality education. And they also will need to research and go beyond their school degree requirements. Hence, this will improve their professional work experience and even better help the understand their capabilities as well as pushing the frontier of technology.</p>\n</blockquote>","excerpt":"Why BuniTek?
