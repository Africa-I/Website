Led by our code-loving instructors, students will be taught key programming concepts and how to apply them in exciting ways, from using Python to create video games to learning the relationship between software and hardware, discovering the role of Python in the multi-billion-dollar tech industry to learning the skills they need to build their own projects at home. Challenging, interactive and lots of fun, this course does more than just teach the fundamentals. It unlocks the world of programming for young people – and sparks the interest that makes them want to keep on exploring it. And, if they want to keep building their knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"markdown_paragraph\">\n  This course aims to start from the very beginning introducing them to concepts such as Sequencing, Selection and Iteration, simple algorithm design and creating modular programs. By the end of the course they will have created programs that are written using functions as well as doing some Object-Oriented Design and using third party libraries such as Pygame and Tkinter to bring graphical elements into their programs. They will finish off by hacking on a project of their own devising using as many of the skills they have learnt as possible.\n  </p>\n<h2 class='markdown__section'>  What you will learn </h2>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Key programming concepts that can be applied to most coding languages</li>\n    <li>How to use Python, an in-demand, syntax-based programming language, to create their own projects</li>\n    <li>The relationship between software and hardware</li>\n    <li>How sensors and outputs work – and how to use them and Python to make their computer speak to the outside world</li>\n    <li>How to use Python to manipulate images and create 2D video games </li>\n  </ol>\n<img class=\"markdown__image\" src=\"https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/lead-images/header.png\">\n<p><br><a href=\"https://forms.gle/m6iuP7JjJ9DynKqo9\" target=\"_blank\"><button class=\"markdown__button is-primary has-bg-primary\">BOOK THIS COURSE  <div class=\"markdown__button__overlay\"></div></button> </a></p>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/courses/available/intro-to-python/"}},{"frontmatter":{"title":"E-commerce Website with WordPress","category":"available","type":"course","date":"2020-08-17","keywords":"BuniTek, BuniTek, mark-down, blogs","author":"BuniTek Team","description":" Learn to develop an e-commerce Website with Wordpress","image":"https://cdn.cyberchimps.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/build-WordPress-ecommerce-store.jpg"},"excerpt":"BOOK THIS COURSE","html":"<div class =\"markdown__content\">\n<h2 class='markdown__section'> <span class=\"test\">Summary <i>(7th - 11th September)</i></span> </h2>\n  <p class=\"markdown_paragraph \">\n    Build an E-Commerce Website using WordPress.  \n  </p>\n<h2 class='markdown__section'> Course Overview </h2>\n  <p class=\"markdown_paragraph\">\n  Today, you can build a fantastic online store with no coding experience at all.
