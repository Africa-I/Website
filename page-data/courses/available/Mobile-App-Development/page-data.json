MIT App Inventor provides an easy-to-learn and easy-to-make platform for beginners to prototype their applications. \n    </p>\n  <h4 class=\"markdown__sub-section\"> <span>Fun learning environment</span> </h4>\n    <p class=\"markdown_paragraph\">\n     Learn how to turn an idea into a viable prototype by including amazing features in your application. The only limitation is your mind, so with guidance from our tutors you will be able to learn, unlearn and relearn skills on mobile app development.   \n    </p>\n<h2 class='markdown__section'> Course Overview </h2>\n  <p class=\"markdown_paragraph\">\n  On this course, students will be introduced to mobile application development using “Drag & Drop”. The course will take advantage of the learner’s creativity and curiosity on functionality needed in their applications. Before commercialization of any application, a prototype is essential as a proof of concept for the idea. In this course, the learner will be introduced and taken through prototyping of applications. Our tutors will take the learners through the fundamentals of mobile app development including the basic features of most apps. It is an interactive course that is aimed at sparking the interest of young learners into proceeding to advanced software development. \n  </p>\n<h2 class='markdown__section'>  What you will learn </h2>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Getting ready and setting up MIT App Inventor</li>\n    <li>User Interface design using buttons, textbox, label etc.</li>\n    <li>Creating functionality using blocks. </li>\n    <li>How to create different screens on apps and link them. </li>\n    <li>App data storage.</li>\n    <li>App data storage.</li>\n    <li>Incorporating communication features in your app e.g. texting, making phone calls </li>\n    <li>Testing your application before building </li>\n  </ol>\n<p><br><a href=\"https://forms.gle/YshP2RryEUeqiXqH9\" target=\"_blank\"><button class=\"markdown__button is-primary has-bg-primary\">BOOK THIS COURSE <div class=\"markdown__button__overlay\"></div></button> </a></p>\n</div>","excerpt":"BOOK THIS COURSE","frontmatter":{"title":"Mobile App Development","keywords":"BuniTek, BuniTek, mark-down, blogs","image":"https://appinventor.mit.edu/images/logo.png","date":"3 months ago","featuredImage":null,"author":"BuniTek Team"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/courses/available/Mobile-App-Development/"}}}
