One of the reason technology is still treated as alien in Africa is mainly because it is taught in foreign languages while most young kids haven't even gotten enough time to master a secondary language. That’s why the majority prefer to get into tech later in life. So, BuniTek will be delivering all of our content in a variety of languages of the areas at which the bootcamps will be taking place, and we will be translating most of the tools in their languages while also making sure the content is comprehensive, yet interactive, simple and fun. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Diversity of our content</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We will be offering a wide variety of content, not just programming, mobile development, or solely using specific tools, rather we acknowledge that people have different interests and talents. Thus, we will be offering various kind of packages where young people will learn various skills and discover their talents from problem-solving, critical thinking, Web technologies, Python to Java, Robotics, 3D Printing, Digital Music Production, video game design, app design, creative design, Vlogging/Blogging, among others as we expand. Our venture will be a hub where technology, artistic skills, humanities intertwine. For instance, design thinking skill is a main factor for delivery of a great user experience (UX) and user interfaces. And the knowledge about drawing highly influences graphic designing skill. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Essentially, creating compelling digital content on digital platforms and digital marketing requires more than using tools, and in most organisation those skills go unheeded, for us it will be one of our focuses as well. Our hackathons will address some particular problems in communities, where collaboration and cultivation of proactivity on taking the first step addressing various problems in their community using their tech skills will be harnessed. </p>\n</blockquote>","fields":{"slug":"/What-BuniTek-Offer/"}},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Mission Statement of BuniTek","date":"2020-06-20","keywords":"BuniTek, BuniTek, Youth, Technology, Africa, Youth, Mission, Vision, Online, Rwanda, Kenya","author":"BuniTek Team","image":null,"featuredImage":"https://www.africandevmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kids.jpg"},"excerpt":"Why BuniTek?

This experience is a\ncommonplace to majority of young\nAfricans and their educations entails\nlearning trivial concepts and spend their\nentire time memorising the names of the\ncomputer components and never learn\nthe big picture and hands-on skills of what\nthe computer technology can help them to\nachieve. Consequently, they wind up\ndropping the subject and concentrating on\nfields they feel directly relate to their life\nreality. This is unacceptable as it leads to\nunder utilisation of talented minds at this\nera the surge of artificial intelligence and\nuse of computer technology in other fields\nis at its peak; there is also relatively a huge\ntechnical and technology skills gap in\nAfrica while it is also imperative that the\ncontinent compete in a digital, global\neconomy. The kids are denied a fair\nchance to explore their abilities just\nbecause of where they were born and the\nfinancial circumstances of their families.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, our mission is to inspire,\nencourage, and give every kid a fair shot at\ndiscovering the technology potential and\nprovide a ground for them to explore and\nemploy their skills to solve problems and\ninvent the future. We will facilitate and\ncreate an environment for young people\nto learn how technology could be used to\nbuild powerful tools and change status\nquo. In addition to arousing interest and\ndisseminating knowledge, we want to\ninspire creativity, innovation and ethics in\nusing technology. Also, we want to\npromote the skills of collaboration,\ncommunication and , critical and design\nthinking in solving problems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, we yearn to build the next\ngeneration of Africa's problem solvers\nbecause we believe that if one is digitally\nliterate and employs the technology\ncapability, there is no problem that is too\nbig solve. Having these thinkers spread out\nin all regions that we plan to cover means\nthat they will be able to come up with\nsolutions specific to their particular areas\nand this will not only inspire development\nbut also will curb the culture of plagiarising\nforeign solutions which rarely works in the\ncontext of Africa. This will heighten the\nliving standards of people in their\ncommunities and foster Africa's economic\ngrowth in the long run.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Our Tutors</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Besides helping the kids, it is also our mission to help the student tutors grow their skills. In preparation for their lessons, we will provide them with trainings and support they need need to provide firstrate education. And they also will need to research and go beyond their school degree requirements. Hence, this will improve their professional work experience and even better help the understand their capabilities as well.</p>\n</blockquote>","fields":{"slug":"/BuniTek-Mission-Statement/"}}],"totalCount":2}},"pageContext":{"skip":0,"currentPage":1}},"staticQueryHashes":["2082293195"]}
