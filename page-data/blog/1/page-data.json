This experience is a commonplace to the majority of young Africans. Their education entails learning trivial concepts and spend the entire time memorising the names of the computer components and never learn the big picture and hands-on skills of what the computer technology can help them to achieve. Consequently, they wind up dropping the subject and concentrating on fields that they feel directly relate to their life reality. This is unacceptable as it leads to under utilisation of talented minds at this era where the surge of artificial intelligence and use of computer technology in other fields is at its peak; inspite of that, there also is,  relatively, a huge technical and technology skill gap in Africa while it is imperative that the continent compete in a digital global economy. The kids are denied a fair chance to explore their abilities just because of where they were born and the financial circumstances of their families.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, our mission is to inspire, encourage, and give every kid a fair shot at discovering the technology potential and provide a ground for them to explore and employ their skills to solve problems and invent the future. We facilitate and create an environment for young people to learn how technology could be used to build powerful tools and change status quo. In addition to arousing interest and disseminating knowledge, we want to inspire creativity, innovation and ethics in using technology. Moreover, we want to promote transferable skills such as collaboration, communication, critical and design thinking in solving problems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, we envisage to build the next generation of Africa's problem solvers because we believe that if one is digitally literate and employs the technology capability, there is no problem that is too big solve. Having these thinkers spread out in all regions of Africa that we plan to cover means, unequivocally, that they will be able to come up with solutions specific to their particular areas and this will not only inspire the development we year, but also will curb the culture of plagiarising foreign solutions which rarely works in the context of Africa. This will heighten the living standards of people in their communities and foster Africa's economic growth in the long run.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Our Tutors</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Besides helping the young people, it is also our mission to help our student tutors grow their skills. In preparation for their lessons, we will provide them with trainings and support they need need to provide first-rate quality education. And they also will need to research and go beyond their school degree requirements. Hence, this will improve their professional work experience and even better help the understand their capabilities as well as pushing the frontier of technology.</p>\n</blockquote>","fields":{"slug":"/BuniTek-Mission-Statement/"}},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Stepping out of Wantrepreneurship into Entrepreneurship","date":"2020-07-29","keywords":"BuniTek, BuniTek, Youth, Technology, Africa, Youth, Mission, Vision, Online, Rwanda, Kenya","author":"Brenda Mionki","image":null,"featuredImage":"https://mcfsp-blogs.ed.ac.uk/scholarslab/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2020/07/blog.png"},"excerpt":"BuniTek “giving generations the power to bring ideas to life” I was very privileged to interview the founders of BuniTek and talk about…","html":"<p>BuniTek “giving generations the power to bring ideas to life”</p>\n<p>I was very privileged to interview the founders of BuniTek and talk about their experience in entrepreneurship, how far they have come and hope to go and most of all, lessons they could share with other scholars on social entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>Daniel and Billy, the cofounders of BuniTek, were among the 13 social enterprises who received the Scholars Enterprise Fund last year (2019) and they were more than thrilled to share the amazing journey of learning that they have gone through.</p>\n<h1>Why BuniTek?</h1>\n<p>“Our generation is so good at reading Tech but not as good at writing it. What if we demystified the tech behind the tech we use and empowered as many African children to use technology to innovate and solve the challenges around them?”</p>\n<p>For BuniTek, programming languages are a universal language that can be taught as any other language that children learn. From personal experiences, the founders have experienced first-hand, how writing tech is designated for the western world due to late introduction to the tech world of young people in Africa to tech. This has led to great dependency to other continents for tech solutions. Tech can be demystified, simplified and accessed by everyone. Tech will also be pivotal in the achievement of many strategic plans of African countries in the near future.</p>\n<h1>Inspirations?</h1>\n<p>“The world is moving fast into industrial digitization. Africa needs to have a chance to take part in this revolution and create tech by Africans for Africa.”</p>\n<p>Currently, tech literacy is very low in Africa. The most popular and sad example was of a video that went viral last year of a teacher teaching about Microsoft Windows while drawing the images on a board because he did not have equipment to teach it. By teaching and making tech available in Africa, it is possible for everyone on the continent to be inspired through tech. I mean, I may be biased, but there is a tech solution for every problem in the world.</p>\n<h1>How do you measure impact? How do you know you are on the right track?</h1>\n<p>“We have a team of 10 volunteers who are real inspiration and joy to work with. They keep up on our toes. We have more and more students engaging with our courses each day and very enthusiastic tutors. We can’t be getting it so wrong if more people are willing to join our course.”</p>\n<p>The team really values continuous learning. The feedback we receive is great and actionable and we keep evolving our courses to suit the needs of our main goal. Impact is measured over time and our main goals are reaching the “unreachable” students in the rural areas, even those areas without internet. We aim to see more students who engage with our courses take up STEM courses. Most of all, we look to inspiring creativity and innovation just to mention one, things like automated irrigation or milking schemes.</p>\n<h1>Lessons from being student entrepreneurs?</h1>\n<p>“Courage. Stepping out of comfort zone. There is no manual of how to run a social enterprise. Most of the things you learn by doing it. Having to work with so many people definitely improves communication skills and project management skills. No degree course teaches you these things”</p>\n<p>Self-responsibility and drive is one of the defining traits of entrepreneurship. Not forgetting decision making. As an entrepreneur, you have to make a lot of decisions regarding the path of the business and also personal wellbeing. Talking to people and having other likeminded ambitious minds to toss your ideas with is very thrilling and mostly gives us the courage to take the first step.</p>\n<h1>Any advice for others wishing to be entrepreneurs/work in start-ups?</h1>\n<p>“Just do it! Feel the fear but do it anyways!”</p>\n<p>You can have your friends as your teammates. It is impossible to sit and analyse every scenario and have all the answers. Make a plan, get a team and just start. There is so much expertise among the people you study with that you can tap into for help.</p>\n<p>You can also book business advisor meeting from Edinburgh Innovations for professional opinion.</p>\n<h1>Future aspirations?</h1>\n<p>“EdTech sector is much bigger than just teaching tech. We hope to create platforms other organisations can use too and teach with”.</p>\n<p>We are currently in a few countries, but we hope to expand to all countries in Africa. We are very keen on adding more content on our courses and reaching as many people as possible.</p>\n<h1>Parting shot?</h1>\n<p>“We are creating simplified, hands-on tech courses to inspire young people to use technology to create solutions.”</p>\n<p>There are so many applications of technology. We aspire for tech to be incorporated in everyday life be it controlling traffic, small scale and large-scale agriculture, in schools etc. By doing this, we hope to have Africa with the power to bring ideas to life.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://mcfsp-blogs.ed.ac.uk/scholarslab/2020/07/29/stepping-out-of-wantrepreneurship-into-entrepreneurship/?preview=true&#x26;_thumbnail_id=384&#x26;fbclid=IwAR0-74jEiOLgFqjNUj3U29A08zD7mdP1FzA0NIR_BLSqEbDZP-qB_OvkYfI\">click here</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/Stepping out of wantrepreneurship into entrepreneurship/"}},{"frontmatter":{"title":"The Current and Future BuniTek's Services","date":"2020-06-22","keywords":"BuniTek, BuniTek, Youth, Technology, Africa, Youth, Bootcamps, Tutoring, Servieces, Rwanda, Kenya","author":"BuniTek Team","image":null,"featuredImage":"https://www.criticalmissioncomputing.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/wordpress-header-img.png"},"excerpt":"Purpose-Oriented Services The core facet of our social venture is developing curricula that are simple, educative, and fun, suited for…","html":"<h3>Purpose-Oriented Services</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The core facet of our social venture is developing curricula that are simple, educative, and fun, suited for people at a young age. One of the reason technology is still treated as alien craft in Africa is mainly because it is taught in foreign languages while most young kids haven't even gotten enough time to master a secondary language. In the other words, the foreign language becomes a pre-requisite to learning essential skills. That’s why the majority prefer to get into tech later in life. That's why BuniTek aims to deliver all of our content in a variety of languages of areas at which the bootcamps will be taking place. We will be translating most of the tools in the local languages while also making sure the content is comprehensive, yet interactive, simple and fun. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Diversity of our content</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We will be offering a wide variety of content, not just programming, mobile development, or solely using specific tools; rather, we acknowledge that people have different interests and talents. Thus, we will be offering various kind of packages where young people will learn various skills and discover their talents from problem-solving, critical thinking, Web technologies, Software developement language (i.e, Python to Java), Robotics, 3D Printing, Digital Music Production, video game design, app design, creative design, Vlogging/Blogging, among others as we expand. Our venture will be a hub where technology, artistic skills, and humanities intertwine. For instance, design thinking skill is a foundation to contrive a great user experience (UX) and user interfaces; or, not to mention how the knowledge about drawing highly influences graphic designing ability. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ultimately, creating compelling digital content on digital platforms requires more than using tools, and, unfortunately, in most organisation, those essential skils those skills go unheeded. At BuniTek, those creative skillset will be one of our focuses as well. Our hackathons will address some particular problems in communities, where collaboration and cultivation of proactivity, encouraging people to take the first step addressing various problems in their community using their tech skills will be harnessed. </p>\n</blockquote>","fields":{"slug":"/What-BuniTek-Offer/"}}],"totalCount":3}},"pageContext":{"skip":0,"currentPage":1}},"staticQueryHashes":["2082293195"]}
