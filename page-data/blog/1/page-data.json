What if we demystified the tech behind the tech we use and empowered as many African children to use technology to innovate and solve the challenges around them?”</p>\n<p>For BuniTek, programming languages are a universal language that can be taught as any other language that children learn. From personal experiences, the founders have experienced first-hand, how writing tech is designated for the western world due to late introduction to the tech world of young people in Africa to tech. This has led to great dependency to other continents for tech solutions. Tech can be demystified, simplified and accessed by everyone. Tech will also be pivotal in the achievement of many strategic plans of African countries in the near future.</p>\n<h1>Inspirations?</h1>\n<p>“The world is moving fast into industrial digitization. Africa needs to have a chance to take part in this revolution and create tech by Africans for Africa.”</p>\n<p>Currently, tech literacy is very low in Africa. The most popular and sad example was of a video that went viral last year of a teacher teaching about Microsoft Windows while drawing the images on a board because he did not have equipment to teach it. By teaching and making tech available in Africa, it is possible for everyone on the continent to be inspired through tech. I mean, I may be biased, but there is a tech solution for every problem in the world.</p>\n<h1>How do you measure impact? How do you know you are on the right track?</h1>\n<p>“We have a team of 10 volunteers who are real inspiration and joy to work with. They keep up on our toes. We have more and more students engaging with our courses each day and very enthusiastic tutors. We can’t be getting it so wrong if more people are willing to join our course.”</p>\n<p>The team really values continuous learning. The feedback we receive is great and actionable and we keep evolving our courses to suit the needs of our main goal. Impact is measured over time and our main goals are reaching the “unreachable” students in the rural areas, even those areas without internet. We aim to see more students who engage with our courses take up STEM courses. Most of all, we look to inspiring creativity and innovation just to mention one, things like automated irrigation or milking schemes.</p>\n<h1>Lessons from being student entrepreneurs?</h1>\n<p>“Courage. Stepping out of comfort zone. There is no manual of how to run a social enterprise. Most of the things you learn by doing it. Having to work with so many people definitely improves communication skills and project management skills. No degree course teaches you these things”</p>\n<p>Self-responsibility and drive is one of the defining traits of entrepreneurship. Not forgetting decision making. As an entrepreneur, you have to make a lot of decisions regarding the path of the business and also personal wellbeing. Talking to people and having other likeminded ambitious minds to toss your ideas with is very thrilling and mostly gives us the courage to take the first step.</p>\n<h1>Any advice for others wishing to be entrepreneurs/work in start-ups?</h1>\n<p>“Just do it! Feel the fear but do it anyways!”</p>\n<p>You can have your friends as your teammates. It is impossible to sit and analyse every scenario and have all the answers. Make a plan, get a team and just start. There is so much expertise among the people you study with that you can tap into for help.</p>\n<p>You can also book business advisor meeting from Edinburgh Innovations for professional opinion.</p>\n<h1>Future aspirations?</h1>\n<p>“EdTech sector is much bigger than just teaching tech. We hope to create platforms other organisations can use too and teach with”.</p>\n<p>We are currently in a few countries, but we hope to expand to all countries in Africa. We are very keen on adding more content on our courses and reaching as many people as possible.</p>\n<h1>Parting shot?</h1>\n<p>“We are creating simple, hands-on tech courses to inspire young people to use technology to create solutions.”</p>\n<p>There are so many applications of technology. We aspire for tech to be incorporated in everyday life be it controlling traffic, small scale and large-scale agriculture, in schools etc. By doing this, we hope to have Africa with the power to bring ideas to life.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://mcfsp-blogs.ed.ac.uk/scholarslab/2020/07/29/stepping-out-of-wantrepreneurship-into-entrepreneurship/?preview=true&#x26;_thumbnail_id=384&#x26;fbclid=IwAR0-74jEiOLgFqjNUj3U29A08zD7mdP1FzA0NIR_BLSqEbDZP-qB_OvkYfI\">click here</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/Stepping out of wantrepreneurship into entrepreneurship/"}},{"frontmatter":{"title":"The Current and Future BuniTek's Services","date":"2020-06-22","keywords":"BuniTek, BuniTek, Youth, Technology, Africa, Youth, Bootcamps, Tutoring, Servieces, Rwanda, Kenya","author":"BuniTek Team","image":null,"featuredImage":"https://i2.wp.com/www.techgistafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/AFRICAN-tech.jpg"},"excerpt":"The core facet of our social venture is developing curricula that are simple, educative, and fun, suited for people at a young age.

One of the reason technology is still treated as alien in Africa is mainly because it is taught in foreign languages while most young kids haven't even gotten enough time to master a secondary language. That’s why the majority prefer to get into tech later in life. So, BuniTek will be delivering all of our content in a variety of languages of the areas at which the bootcamps will be taking place, and we will be translating most of the tools in their languages while also making sure the content is comprehensive, yet interactive, simple and fun. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Diversity of our content</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We will be offering a wide variety of content, not just programming, mobile development, or solely using specific tools, rather we acknowledge that people have different interests and talents. Thus, we will be offering various kind of packages where young people will learn various skills and discover their talents from problem-solving, critical thinking, Web technologies, Python to Java, Robotics, 3D Printing, Digital Music Production, video game design, app design, creative design, Vlogging/Blogging, among others as we expand. Our venture will be a hub where technology, artistic skills, humanities intertwine. For instance, design thinking skill is a main factor for delivery of a great user experience (UX) and user interfaces. And the knowledge about drawing highly influences graphic designing skill. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Essentially, creating compelling digital content on digital platforms and digital marketing requires more than using tools, and in most organisation those skills go unheeded, for us it will be one of our focuses as well. Our hackathons will address some particular problems in communities, where collaboration and cultivation of proactivity on taking the first step addressing various problems in their community using their tech skills will be harnessed. </p>\n</blockquote>","fields":{"slug":"/What-BuniTek-Offer/"}},{"frontmatter":{"title":"BuniTek's Mission Statement","date":"2020-06-20","keywords":"BuniTek, BuniTek, Youth, Technology, Africa, Youth, Mission, Vision, Online, Rwanda, Kenya","author":"BuniTek Team","image":null,"featuredImage":"https://www.africandevmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kids.jpg"},"excerpt":"Why BuniTek?

This experience is a\ncommonplace to majority of young\nAfricans and their educations entails\nlearning trivial concepts and spend their\nentire time memorising the names of the\ncomputer components and never learn\nthe big picture and hands-on skills of what\nthe computer technology can help them to\nachieve. Consequently, they wind up\ndropping the subject and concentrating on\nfields they feel directly relate to their life\nreality. This is unacceptable as it leads to\nunder utilisation of talented minds at this\nera the surge of artificial intelligence and\nuse of computer technology in other fields\nis at its peak; there is also relatively a huge\ntechnical and technology skills gap in\nAfrica while it is also imperative that the\ncontinent compete in a digital, global\neconomy. The kids are denied a fair\nchance to explore their abilities just\nbecause of where they were born and the\nfinancial circumstances of their families.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, our mission is to inspire,\nencourage, and give every kid a fair shot at\ndiscovering the technology potential and\nprovide a ground for them to explore and\nemploy their skills to solve problems and\ninvent the future. We will facilitate and\ncreate an environment for young people\nto learn how technology could be used to\nbuild powerful tools and change status\nquo. In addition to arousing interest and\ndisseminating knowledge, we want to\ninspire creativity, innovation and ethics in\nusing technology. Also, we want to\npromote the skills of collaboration,\ncommunication and , critical and design\nthinking in solving problems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, we yearn to build the next\ngeneration of Africa's problem solvers\nbecause we believe that if one is digitally\nliterate and employs the technology\ncapability, there is no problem that is too\nbig solve. Having these thinkers spread out\nin all regions that we plan to cover means\nthat they will be able to come up with\nsolutions specific to their particular areas\nand this will not only inspire development\nbut also will curb the culture of plagiarising\nforeign solutions which rarely works in the\ncontext of Africa. This will heighten the\nliving standards of people in their\ncommunities and foster Africa's economic\ngrowth in the long run.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Our Tutors</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Besides helping the kids, it is also our mission to help the student tutors grow their skills. In preparation for their lessons, we will provide them with trainings and support they need need to provide firstrate education. And they also will need to research and go beyond their school degree requirements. Hence, this will improve their professional work experience and even better help the understand their capabilities as well.</p>\n</blockquote>","fields":{"slug":"/BuniTek-Mission-Statement/"}}],"totalCount":3}},"pageContext":{"skip":0,"currentPage":1}},"staticQueryHashes":["2082293195"]}
