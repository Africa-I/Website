<h2 class='markdown__section'> Course Overview </h2>
  <p class="markdown_paragraph">
  Turtlestitch  is based on a browser-based educational programming language (Snap!) to generate patterns for embroidery machines.

TurtleStitch curriculum covers both concepts in drag-and-drop programming while incorporating the practical bit of stitching the designs created. 
Students will learn on different stitches and spend time brainstorming on the designs they will create even from the shortest of lessons with a single concept.
Mathematical concepts will be used to explain design patterns while programming concepts such as loops and functions will compress the math  and bring to life beautiful designs.

Educators are encouraged to introduce the concepts briefly and allow students use their own choice of patterns to achieve each project.


**The end goal is to have a canvas (like below) for all your class designs hence students should work to have different designs. It can be in hard copy, or soft copy canvas.
