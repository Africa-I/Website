  The course seeks to take the students' experiences from completing our <a href="/courses/available/python/">Introduction to Python course </a> and enable them to look at some of the topics in more depth. It also introduces some of the concepts that software developers have to deal with on a daily basis, but which aren't directly programming related such as installing libraries, evaluating code editors and automated testing of software. 
  </p>


<h2 class='markdown__section'> Course Overview </h2>
  <p class="markdown_paragraph">
    On this course, students will be introduced to advanced concepts of Python, the programming language that tech behemoths like Instagram, Pinterest and Spotify are all built on. Led by our code-loving instructors,students will be taught key programming concepts and how to apply them in exciting ways, from using Python to create video games to learning the relationship between software and hardware, discovering the role of Python in the multi-billion-dollar tech industry to learning the skills they need to build their own projects at home. Challenging, interactive and lots of fun, this course does more than just teach the fundamentals. It unlocks the world of programming for young people â€“ and sparks the interest that makes them want to keep on exploring it. And, if they want to keep building their knowledge.
