### Why Africa-I?

> Most young children in Africa don't
encounter a computer until they get into
high school - and only if they manage to
attend good schools. This experience is a
commonplace to majority of young
Africans and their educations entails
learning trivial concepts and spend their
entire time memorising the names of the
computer components and never learn
the big picture and hands-on skills of what
the computer technology can help them to
achieve. Consequently, they wind up
dropping the subject and concentrating on
fields they feel directly relate to their life
reality. This is unacceptable as it leads to
under utilisation of talented minds at this
era the surge of artificial intelligence and
use of computer technology in other fields
is at its peak; there is also relatively a huge
technical and technology skills gap in
Africa while it is also imperative that the
continent compete in a digital, global
economy. The kids are denied a fair
chance to explore their abilities just
because of where they were born and the
financial circumstances of their families.

>Therefore, our mission is to inspire,
encourage, and give every kid a fair shot at
discovering the technology potential and
provide a ground for them to explore and
employ their skills to solve problems and
invent the future. We will facilitate and
create an environment for young people
to learn how technology could be used to
build powerful tools and change status
quo. In addition to arousing interest and
disseminating knowledge, we want to
inspire creativity, innovation and ethics in
using technology. Also, we want to
promote the skills of collaboration,
communication and , critical and design
thinking in solving problems.

> Furthermore, we yearn to build the next
generation of Africa's problem solvers
because we believe that if one is digitally
literate and employs the technology
capability, there is no problem that is too
big solve. Having these thinkers spread out
in all regions that we plan to cover means
that they will be able to come up with
solutions specific to their particular areas
and this will not only inspire development
but also will curb the culture of plagiarising
foreign solutions which rarely works in the
context of Africa. This will heighten the
living standards of people in their
communities and foster Africa's economic
growth in the long run.

### Others

> Besides helping the kids, it is also our mission to help the student tutors grow their skills. In preparation for their lessons, we will provide them with trainings and support they need need to provide firstrate education. And they also will need to research and go beyond their school degree requirements. Hence, this will improve their professional work experience and even better help the understand their capabilities as well. Expand on your previous description of how your social venture will address the issue you have identified. Please address the strengths and unique aspects of the As we discussed previously in our social venture description , we will be organising seasonal bootcamps in different places in Africa to provide a ground for kids to experiment with a wide range of technology concepts.
