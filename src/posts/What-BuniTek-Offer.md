### Purpose-Oriented Services
> The core facet of our social venture is developing curricula that are simple, educative, and fun, suited for people at a young age. One of the reason technology is still treated as alien craft in Africa is mainly because it is taught in foreign languages while most young kids haven't even gotten enough time to master a secondary language. In the other words, the foreign language becomes a pre-requisite to learning essential skills. Thatâ€™s why the majority prefer to get into tech later in life. That's why BuniTek aims to deliver all of our content in a variety of languages of areas at which the bootcamps will be taking place. We will be translating most of the tools in the local languages while also making sure the content is comprehensive, yet interactive, simple and fun. 

### Diversity of our content
> We will be offering a wide variety of content, not just programming, mobile development, or solely using specific tools; rather, we acknowledge that people have different interests and talents. Thus, we will be offering various kind of packages where young people will learn various skills and discover their talents from problem-solving, critical thinking, Web technologies, Software developement language (i.e, Python to Java), Robotics, 3D Printing, Digital Music Production, video game design, app design, creative design, Vlogging/Blogging, among others as we expand. Our venture will be a hub where technology, artistic skills, and humanities intertwine. For instance, design thinking skill is a foundation to contrive a great user experience (UX) and user interfaces; or, not to mention how the knowledge about drawing highly influences graphic designing ability. 

> Ultimately, creating compelling digital content on digital platforms requires more than using tools, and, unfortunately, in most organisation, those essential skils those skills go unheeded. At BuniTek, those creative skillset will be one of our focuses as well. Our hackathons will address some particular problems in communities, where collaboration and cultivation of proactivity, encouraging people to take the first step addressing various problems in their community using their tech skills will be harnessed.
